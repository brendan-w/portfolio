			<p>
				I am a programmer and interactive developer. I enjoy almost everything code related, and have a passion for building systems and mechanisms. I have always been compelled to build and tinker, both in my spare time, and at work. From C++ to flameworking, I'll learn whatever I have to to scratch my itch.

				Currently, I am a senior majoring in New Media Interactive Developement at <a href='http://www.rit.edu/'>Rochester Institute of Technology</a>. While my major satisfies my love for interactive systems, I am equally interested in what goes on behind the scenes. Algorithms, cryptography, and kernel programming are all topics that I persue. To that end, I have also developed a strong interest in the Free &amp; Open Source Software community, and am proud to be <a href="http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html">minoring in FOSS at RIT</a>.

				In my spare time, I can be found playing guitar, doing fun things with lasers, and woodworking. My passions music and woodworking have since led me to the art of building pipe organs, and I am currently designing my 3<sup>rd</sup> organ (no joke). I also work as a glass artist at <a href='http://robinlehmanglass.com/'>Robin Lehman Glass</a>, a local shop here in Rochester.
