				One of my admittedly weirder interests is pipe organs. Given my love of woodworking, music, and mechanisms, I decided it would be a fun challenge to build a working pipe organ. After completing a small two octave prototype in 2010, I began work on a larger, more elaborate pipe organ for my bedroom. This organ (when complete) will have 41 pipes and stand a little over 7 feet tall.

				As if the second pipe organ wasn't ambitious enough, I have already found myself designing a 3rd. This one will be more sleak and modern, and carry 3 ranks (2', 4' and 8'). Motorized wing will (hopefully) extend from the main case, making it space efficient and 10x more awesome. Obviously, I have a lot of work ahead of me on the mechanical engineering front, but that's never stopped me before.
