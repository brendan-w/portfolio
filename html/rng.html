                At its core, this project is a random number generator that uses a custom Linux kernel module to gather entropy from radiation. Formally, it was done for a class on Open Source Culture. The topic at hand was the concept of a black box; A device whose inputs and outputs are known, but its internals are not. For a term project, I decided to take this concept literally.
            </p>
            <p>
                The black box I constructed is advertised as a closed source symmetric-key encryption device that produces "unbreakable" ciphertext. Users may submit text to be encrypted or decrypted, but the details of the encryption remain a mystery. With the intention of raising suspicion over closed source cryptography, I decided to make the internals of the box quite duplicitous.

            <p>
                The "encryption" that the device performs is nothing more than a lookup table joining the user's plaintext with randomly generated ciphertext. While devious, I figured I could take this a step further. So, to generate the random ciphertext, I built a hardware random number generator using readings from a geiger counter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The RNG works by placing a geiger counter next to a radioactive source, causing it to produce a flury of clicks. Since each click is the result of chaotic nuclear decay, the interval between one click and the next is essentially random.

            <p>The box itself is actually built from a black toolbox. Its surface has been made largely featureless, except for a lock and a single ethernet port. The device is self powered, and does not require any other connections to function.</p>

            <p>The Raspberry Pi sits on an adjustable platform, exposing only it's ethernet port. The connections are for <code>GND</code>, <code>5V</code>, and the geiger counter's <code>Pulse</code> pin.</p>

            <p>The geiger counter is suspended directly above an aluminum tray containing the radioactive source. The 1/4" hole on the top of the tray is the emission window, which exposes the counter to continuous beta radiation.</p>

                To make this work, I first needed to acquire a radioactive check source. Luckily, the internet is a wonderful place, and there are many license exempt options to choose from. Ultimately, I purchased a small epoxy-encased disk meant for the educational market. My isotope-of-choice was Strontium-90, a beta emitter, with a half-life of ~28 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the detector, I purchased the <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/">MightyOhm Geiger Counter</a> as a kit. It's open source, exceptionally easy to assemble, and even has serial logging capabilites. Overall, a great product, and perfect to experiments such as this.
            </p>
            <p>
                To turn the gieger counter's clicks into random numbers, I implemented a small Linux kernel module that feeds entropy to <code>/dev/random</code> via the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/hw_random.h?id=refs/tags/v4.4">hardware RNG API</a>. The module uses the Linux kernel's builtin <code>GPIO</code> facilities to watch for short (100Î¼s) pulses from the counter. By registering a rising interupt, it can maintain a buffer of timestamps from each pulse. Each timestamp provides nanosecond resolution for the timing of a pulse. When the RNG API requests data, the raw timestamps are sent, and are stirred into the entropy pool by the kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being unfamiliar with kernel-space programming, this project actually served as a decent introduction. As time goes on, I'd like to start running tests on the entropy quality and throughput of the system as a whole.
