				Collector is an experimentall tag-based file manager for linux. It presents the user's files as a flat data structure, where they can be selected by tag name, or by manual inclusion and exclusion. These tags can be arbitrarily added or removed from files, and can even be queried with logical set operations.

				While many commercial operating systems already support some form of file tagging, linux does not, and it is difficult to port existing data from one OS to another. Because of this, I chose to store tags directly in the file's name and path. This allows directories to function as tags, and helps to represent existing folder structures in Collector. When tags are added or removed, Collector will either splice text from the file name, or move the file to a different place in the directory tree. Not only does this help maintain an organized directory structure, but also prevents the need to synchronize a tag database with the filesystem.

			<p>
				Collector displays files as a continuous spectrum of square tiles. Files can be selected by simply typing tag selectors into the bar at the top of the window. This will illuminate the selected files in the spectrum, and will load thumbnail previews in the lower half of the window. To help navigate the tag-space, sample tag names are displayed underneath various regions of the spectrum, and a list of sub-tags for the current selection is also shown.
			</p>

				Double-clicking on a file (either the tile, or the preview) will open that file in the user's default application. Out of the box, this is done using the <a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open'>xdg-open</a> utility. When files are opened, Collector will also fill a temporary directory with symlinks to the currently selected files. This makes it easy to work with your file selections in other programs, such as image preview applications.

	<h3>CLI</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col">
			<p>
				In an effort to follow the doctrine of UNIX, Collector has spawned a seperate CLI application to handle the grunt-work of manipulating tags. This CLI, written in python, allows directory structures to be accessed as if they were sets of tagged files. Multiple tags can be added or removed from files with a single command. Files can also be queried with logical set operations, just like Collector.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tags are parsed from the filepath by splitting them on several delimeters. Currently, these delimeters are
				<code>,_&amp;=%.-+ ()[]{}/\</code>. For instance, the following file path would be parsed into these tags:
			</p>
			<p><code>/sensors &amp; measurement/telescopes/james_web_primary_mirror.jpg</code></p>
			<p><code>sensors</code>&nbsp;<code>measurement</code>&nbsp;<code>telescopes</code>&nbsp;<code>james</code>&nbsp;<code>web</code>&nbsp;<code>primary</code>&nbsp;<code>mirror</code></p>
			<p>
				For safety, file extensions are always ignored, and will never be operated upon during the tagging process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since directory names can function as tags, the addition or removal of tags may move a file to a different directory. To prevent files from being moved too far, a <code>.tagdir</code> file can be placed at the root of your desired folder structure. This will mark a boundry for file movements, and will later store user settings for that particular tag directory.
