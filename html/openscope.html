                This is a software package for turning an Arduino into a cheap oscilloscope. The front-end is written in Processing, and provides controls for pin selection, triggering, and sample rate. Data is collected via the Arduinoâ€™s 6 ADC pins, and triggered/buffered on the chip. This allows for sample rates of up to 25kHz.

                In order to achieve better results, it was neccessary to process and buffer the signal on the Arduino itself. While this does present severe memory constrictions, it goes a long way to preserve the temporal consistancy of the readings. Triggering (signal stabalization) can also be done in the Arduino, and helps prevent the sending of undisplayed data. This alone dramatically increases the sample rate of the system. More speed was also coaxed out of the <code>analogRead()</code> by <a href='http://www.microsmart.co.za/technical/2014/03/01/advanced-arduino-adc/'>adjusting prescale registers in the AVR</a>.

                The interface is built with <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">controlP5</a> by Andreas Schlegel, and provides the basic tools of a standard oscilloscope. When changed, these settings are seemlessly uploaded to the Arduino for faster access.
