				This is a heads-up display for a car, built to run on a Raspberry Pi. It uses my <a href='/python-obd'>Python OBD-II serial module</a> to stream live data from the car. The software autodetects available sensors, and provides a primitive interface for users to design their HUD. Widgets representing the various sensors can be added, deleted, positioned, and resized to the drivers liking.

				Currently, PiHUD has widgets for displaying data as gauges, bar graphs, and text/numeral readouts. However, custom widgets can easily be made using plugins that extend the base widget class. This flexibility allows users to further customize their displays.
