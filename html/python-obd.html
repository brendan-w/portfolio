				This python module serves as a back-end for projects using sensor data from a car's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics'>OBD-II port</a>. Using industry standard OBD-II adapters, it seamlessly handles decoding of data from the car. The module comes with builtin tables for accessing standard sensors, and returns unit-aware values to the programmer. Built with the intention of decoupling serial and UI code, it also comes with utilities for asynchronous IO.

				This project actually started as a fork of <a href='https://github.com/peterh/pyobd'>pyobd</a> for a class project Free and Open Source Software. Since then, the code has been completely overhauled. The library now makes better use of the Python stdlib, supports more sensors, and has been thoroughly documented. It is currently released as a module on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obd">PyPi</a>, and can be installed with <code>pip install obd</code>.

	<h3>Code Examples</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col">
			<pre><code class="language-python">
import obd

connection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port

cmd = obd.commands.RPM # select an OBD command (sensor)

response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command

print(response) # "2410 RPM"
            </code></pre>
            <p>This is a simple script that prints the current RPM of the engine. Sensors (commands) can be accessed by name, or Parameter ID. The returned <code>Response</code> object contains all of the decoded information from the request, such as the value and unit for the sensor. This module is fully unit-aware, thanks to <a href="http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pint</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<pre><code class="language-python">
import obd
import time

connection = obd.Async() # create an asynchronous connection

# will continuously print new RPM values
def new_value(response):
	print(response)

# keep track of the car's RPM
connection.watch(obd.commands.RPM, callback=new_value)

connection.start()
time.sleep(5) # do other work in the main thread
connection.stop()
            </code></pre>
            <p>Python-OBD also has facilities for asynchronous usage. Particularly useful within UI event loops, <code>Async</code> connections are executed in a separate thread, and provide event callbacks. The traditional <code>query()</code> function also becomes non-blocking during asynchronous connections.</p>

	<h3>Sensors</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col">
			<p>
				Python-OBD supports a wide variety of sensors. However, because each car has a different payload of those sensors, not all of them may be available. To account for this, the library will automatically request a sensor list from the vehicle, and mark the corresponding commands as "supported". A list of support commands is stored on the connection object.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a handful of the sensors that python-OBD supports. For a full list of sensors, see the <a href='http://python-obd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Command%20Tables/'>documentation</a>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Calculated Engine Load</li>
				<li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li>
				<li>Fuel Pressure</li>
				<li>Intake Manifold Pressure</li>
				<li>Engine RPM</li>
				<li>Vehicle Speed</li>
				<li>Timing Advance</li>
				<li>Intake Air Temp</li>
				<li>Air Flow Rate (MAF)</li>
				<li>Throttle Position</li>
				<li>Engine Run Time</li>
				<li>Fuel Level Input</li>
				<li>Barometric Pressure</li>
				<li>Time since trouble codes cleared</li>
				<li>Hybrid battery pack remaining life</li>
				<li>Engine fuel rate</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<p>
				Non-sensor data, such as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can also be retrieved. For instance, <code>connection.query(obd.commands.GET_DTC).value</code> will return a list of every trouble code in the vehicle. Since the trouble codes themselves aren't very meaningful, this library also has a built-in dictionary of code descriptions, which get resolved automatically.
			</p>
			<p>
				If there's ever a sensor or command that python-OBD doesn't support, it is possible send custom commands to the car. For instance, here is the implementation for the RPM command:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-python">
from obd import OBDCommand, Unit
from obd.protocols import ECU
from obd.utils import bytes_to_int

def rpm(messages):
    """ decoder for RPM messages """
    d = messages[0].data
    v = bytes_to_int(d) / 4.0  # helper function for converting byte arrays to ints
    return v * Unit.RPM # construct a Pint Quantity

cmd = OBDCommand("RPM", \          # name
                 "Engine RPM", \   # description
                 b"010C", \        # command
                 2, \              # number of return bytes to expect
                 rpm, \            # decoding function
                 ECU.ENGINE, \     # (optional) ECU filter
                 True)             # (optional) allow a "01" to be added for speed            </code></pre>

	<h3>Use Case</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class='col'>
			<p>
				This library was actually prompted by another project of mine called PiHUD. It is a simple heads-up display that runs on a Raspberry Pi. Using Python-OBD, it can stream live engine data from the car, and display it as gauges on a small screen. The UI was written with PyQt, and allows users to design and customize their own HUD. Widgets representing the various sensors can be added, deleted, positioned, and resized to the drivers liking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, PiHUD has widgets for displaying data as gauges, bar graphs, and text/numeral readouts. However, custom widgets can easily be made using plugins that extend the base widget class. This flexibility allows users to further customize their displays.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project is also open source, and can be found on my GitHub:
