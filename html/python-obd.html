				This python module serves as a back-end for projects using sensor data from a car's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics'>OBD-II port</a>. It seamlessly handles the decoding of data from the car, and returns values with units to the programmer. Derived from the popular <a href='https://github.com/peterh/pyobd'>pyobd</a> project, this package attempts to do a better job of decoupling the serial operations from the UI code.

				This project started as a fork of another OBD project called pyobd. Since then, the code has been almost completely overhauled. The library now makes better use of the Python stdlib, supports more sensors, and presents a simple API for accessing the car's data. Sensors (commands) can now be accessed by name, or Parameter ID. Threaded callbacks can also be subscribed, allowing for asynchronous applications.

	<h3>Code Examples</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col">
			<pre><code class="language-python">
import obd

connection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port

cmd = obd.commands.RPM # select an OBD command (sensor)

response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command

print(response) # "2410 RPM"
            </code></pre>
            <p>This is a simple script that prints the current RPM of the engine. <code>Response</code> objects contain all of the decoded information from the request, such as the value and units for the sensor.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<pre><code class="language-python">
import obd
import time

connection = obd.Async() # create an asynchronous connection

# will continuously print new RPM values
def new_value(response):
	print(response)

# keep track of the car's RPM
connection.watch(obd.commands.RPM, callback=new_value)

connection.start()
time.sleep(5) # do other work in the main thread
connection.stop()
            </code></pre>
            <p>Python-OBD also has facilities for asynchronous usage. Particularly useful with UI event loops, <code>Async</code> connections are executed in a separate thread, and provide event callbacks. The traditional <code>query()</code> function also becomes non-blocking during asynchronous connections.</p>

	<h3>Sensors</h3>
	<div class="row">

			<p>
				Python-OBD supports a wide variety of sensors. However, because each car has a different payload of those sensors, not all of them may be available. To account for this, the library will automatically request a sensor list from the vehicle, and mark the corresponding commands as "supported". A list of support commands is also stored on the connection object for convenience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a handful of the sensors that python-OBD supports. For a full list of sensors, see the <a href='http://python-obd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Commands/#mode-01'>documentation</a>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Calculated Engine Load</li>
				<li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li>
				<li>Fuel Pressure</li>
				<li>Intake Manifold Pressure</li>
				<li>Engine RPM</li>
				<li>Vehicle Speed</li>
				<li>Timing Advance</li>
				<li>Intake Air Temp</li>
				<li>Air Flow Rate (MAF)</li>
				<li>Throttle Position</li>
				<li>Engine Run Time</li>
				<li>Fuel Level Input</li>
				<li>Barometric Pressure</li>
				<li>Time since trouble codes cleared</li>
				<li>Hybrid battery pack remaining life</li>
				<li>Engine fuel rate</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<p>
				Non-sensor data, such as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can also be retrieved. For instance, <code>connection.query(obd.commands.GET_DTC).value</code> will return a list of every trouble code in the vehicle. Since the trouble codes themselves aren't very meaningful, this library also has a built-in dictionary of code descriptions, which get resolved automatically.  
			</p>
			<p>
				If there's ever a sensor or command that python-OBD doesn't support, it is possible send custom commands to the car. For instance, here is the implementation for the RPM command:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-python">
from obd import OBDCommand
from obd.utils import unhex

def rpm(_hex):
    v = unhex(_hex) # helper function to convert hex to int
    v = v / 4.0
    return (v, obd.Unit.RPM)

cmd = OBDCommand("RPM",        \ # name
                 "Engine RPM", \ # description
                 "01",         \ # mode
                 "0C",         \ # PID
                 2,            \ # number of bytes returned
                 rpm)            # decoding function
            </code></pre>
