				One of these images represents a .DLL file, and the other a .WAV file. Can you tell which is which?

				It all started with this <a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_domas_the_1s_and_0s_behind_cyber_warfare'>TED talk by Chris Domas</a>. During the presentation, he shows some elegant visualizations of raw binary data. The first is an adjacency map, with the value of any given byte (n) on the X-axis, and the value of the next byte (n+1) on the Y-axis. This creates a beautiful frequency map of the byte patterns in a given file, and it is remarkably good at distinguishing the fileâ€™s contents.

				Of course, this was simply too cool, and I immediatly went and made my own to play with (click "Run" at the top of the page). Simply drag and drop your files into the page, and it will assemble your very own visualization (I promise, the files never leave the page).

				Chris Domas has released a <a href='https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Arsenal/Domas/_cantor.dust_.7z.zip'>demo</a> version of his software <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/xxcantorxdustxx/home'>..cantor.dust..</a>. He also gave a very good <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bM3Gut1hIk'>Derbycon talk</a>, which goes into detail about each visualization.

				While my software is only a simple web app, I fully intend to continue exploring the topic of data visualization for reverse engineering. I am currently playing with <a href='http://www.openframeworks.cc/'>openFrameworks</a> as a possible display framework for future iterations of this project.
